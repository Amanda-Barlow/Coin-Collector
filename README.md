# Coin-Collector
A full stack application using Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS to allow coin collectors to list all of the coins in their collection.  Users will be able to add, edit and delete items.

Project Description: As a beginning coin collector, I have a stack of coins that I would like to catalog. I want to be able to see my coin collection from wherever I am and to be able to update the collection as I go. Coin Collector is a site where a user can display their coin collection. The user will be able to easily access their coin database from anywhere and to access details about each coin. The user will be able to add details of the coin and there will be a link to a popular coin valuation company. User will be able to edit and delete coins data as needed.
